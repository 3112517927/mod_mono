	* src/MonoWorkerRequest.cs: added a MapPathEvent that is fired before
	doing the normal MapPath stuff and can provide alternate mappings.

2003-03-11  Daniel Lopez Ridruejo <daniel @ rawbyte.com>
	* src/Request.cs: We need to check for length returned equal to 0 in alias_matches
	* src/mod_mono.c: fixed bug when matching prefix that made mod_mono handle all pages even those
	outside MonoApplication scope. Also fixed the way alias_matches is exposed to Request
	* FAQ.txt: Added some answers about Apache 1.3 and how to use proxypass
	* packaging/redhat/mod_mono.spec: Update to 0.3.6
	
2003-02-25  Daniel Lopez Ridruejo <daniel @ rawbyte.com>
	Bring it up to date with Mono 0.20
	* src/mod_mono.c: added mono_thread_attach (thanks Dick). Return NULL if header not found.
	* src/ApacheApplicationHost.cs: Add an internal method so the call will
	be made in the right domain, as suggested by Dietmar. This can be done from C, but was added after 
	Mono 0.20. It also required a serialization constructor for IntPtr that Gonzalo promptly added, thanks!
	* packaging/redhat/mod_mono.spec: Update for latest versions
