	* INSTALL: Add new config instructions. Only a MonoApplication directive is needed right now
	* src/mod_mono.c: Get rid of LoadModMonoDll, per Miguel suggestion, we look for the assembly
	in the assembly path now. Add MonoApplication directive, this simplies compfiguration greatly.
	* src/Makefile.am : makedll.mak was not being included in the distribution

2003-01-03  Daniel Lopez Ridruejo <daniel @ rawbyte.com>
	* src/mod_mono.c: Added support functions for reading HTTP bodies,
	this enables POST support:
	mono_apache_should_client_block,
	mono_apache_setup_client_block,
	mono_apache_get_client_block
	* src/ApacheWorkerRequest : Added ReadEntityBody
	* src/Request : Added ShouldClientBlock, SetupClientBlock, GetClientBlock

	* src/mod_mono.c: Fix ApacheApplicationHost creation:
	Method signature uses intptr and method to invoke is static.
	Pass request to ProcessRequest()	
	* src/ApacheWorkerRequest.cs: Add GetFilePathTranslated, since
	is not mapping correctly in MonoWorkerRequest

	* INSTALL: changed instructions on how to build ModMono.dll.

	application hosts.
	* src/MonoWorkerRequest.cs: base class that will be shared between
	mod_mono and xsp server.
	* src/Request.cs: merged previous Connection and Request classes. Made
	all methods non-static. Store results from calling internal calls in
	private fields.
	* src/ApacheApplicationHost.cs: application host for mod_mono.
	* src/ApacheWorkerRequest.cs: it derives now from MonoWorkerRequest.

	* src/mod_mono.c: it now creates an ApacheApplicationHost and then call
	ProcessRequest on every request.

	* src/Makefile.am: added MONO_CFLAGS and new source files.
	* src/makedll.mak: use this to build ModMono.dll.
