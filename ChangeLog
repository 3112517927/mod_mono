	* src/mod_mono.c: Fix ApacheApplicationHost creation:
	Method signature uses intptr and method to invoke is static.
	Pass request to ProcessRequest()	
	* src/ApacheWorkerRequest.cs: Add GetFilePathTranslated, since
	is not mapping correctly in MonoWorkerRequest

	* AUTHORS: added myself.
	* INSTALL: changed instructions on how to build ModMono.dll.
	* src/IApplicationHost.cs: interface to be implemented by asp.net
	application hosts.
	* src/MonoWorkerRequest.cs: base class that will be shared between
	mod_mono and xsp server.

	all methods non-static. Store results from calling internal calls in
	private fields.
	* src/ApacheApplicationHost.cs: application host for mod_mono.
	* src/ApacheWorkerRequest.cs: it derives now from MonoWorkerRequest.

	* src/mod_mono.c: it now creates an ApacheApplicationHost and then call
	ProcessRequest on every request.

	* src/Makefile.am: added MONO_CFLAGS and new source files.
	* src/makedll.mak: use this to build ModMono.dll.

	* src/ModMono.cs: Removed file. It's been splitted.
