Installation and troubleshooting

If you get a blank page or a stack trace instead of the page you expected,
something went wrong. To find out what, the most useful place to look at is the 
Apache error_log file. If you installed Apache from source as explained it
will be in /usr/local/apache2/logs, if you use Red Hat, it will be in 
/var/logs/httpd/

1) I get an error about a .wapi/ directory

Mono creates that directory in the home of the current user. When you are running
Mono inside Apache, it tries to create that directory in the home of the user
Apache is running as. This will be solved in future releases, but for now the following hack
should work:

If you get something like

** (process:2899): CRITICAL **: : shared file [/var/www/.wapi/shared_data-0] open error: No such file or directory

Then you need to issue the following commands, as root

mkdir /var/www/.wapi/
chown apache.apache /var/www/.wapi
chmod 700 /var/www/.wapi


2) I get an error about a missing tmpxxxxxxxxx.dll

Something along the lines of

Unhandled Exception: System.UnauthorizedAccessException: Access to the path "./tmp1632595207.dll" is denied.

This is likely because the ASP page compiler does not have permission to create that intermediate file,
probably because the user apache is running as does not have permission to write in that directory.

The following should fix it

chown -R apache.apache /home/user/mono/install/xsp/server/test
